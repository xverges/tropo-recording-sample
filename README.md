Updated a Tropo recording sample https://github.com/tropo/tropo-samples/blob/master/javascript/recording-node-webapi.js

discussed in https://www.tropo.com/docs/webapi/tutorials/nodejs-voice-recording-example

Runs on Bluemix.

The tropo API is ugly and buggy. Maybe it is being obsolted by https://www.npmjs.com/package/tropo ?
